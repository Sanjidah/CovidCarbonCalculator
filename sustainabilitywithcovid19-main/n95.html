<p1>The N95 mask is considered to filter out air particles better than the traditional blue surgical mask and has become a popular facemask choice.
In NYC it is seen less often however, in Asia it is a common choice. As the graph to the right shows the mask generates a lot of waste compared to a 
reuseable mask. Therefore, to reduce waste consider purchasing or making a reuseable mask, and staying indoors more often.
