# Covid-19 Carbon Calculator
This website helps people calculate their carbon footprint of single use plastic items that have been prominently used throughout the pandemic. Through research, the individual carbon footprints of each single use plastic item were found and implemented with the calculator. This information is then used to provide options on other ways people can offset their carbon emissions. The website also provides fast facts on Covid-19's plastic pollution and updates on the environmental impact of the virus to create awareness of the collateral effects of the virus.
