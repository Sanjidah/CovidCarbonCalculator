# Covid-19 Carbon Calculator: CUNY Hackathon
This website helps people calculate their carbon footprint of single use plastic items that have been prevalent throughout the pandemic. This information is then used to provide options on other ways people can offset their carbon emissions. It also provides fast facts on Covid-19's plastic pollution and updates on the environmental impact of the virus to create awareness of the collateral effects of the virus.
