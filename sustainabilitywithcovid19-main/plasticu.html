<p1>Their has been a massive uptick in the use of single-use plastic utensils due to sanitary concerns revoloving around covid. Many resturants are also takeout only and
provide plastic utensils with every order. To reduce this waste you can carry your own reuseable utensil set. You can also ask the person taking your order at a resturant not to 
include utensils. Finally, you can also cook at home.
