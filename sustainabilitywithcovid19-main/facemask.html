<p1>To help reduce waste consider purchasing a reusable mask as this will reduce waste and carbon emmissions
 Only go outside whe necessary, and consider sewing your own masks as a household activity!
 To increase the effectiveness of the mask make sure it covers your mouth and nose and is not too loose. 
 Finally wash your mask daily to avoid sickness.
